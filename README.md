# Obsidian Task Decorations

The purpose of this plugin is to enhance the task management experience within Obsidian by integrating task oriented features.

## Key Features
- **Task latency**: Shows how much time has passed from creation in a not completed task, and the time passed from creation to closure on closed tasks.


## Roadmap
- **Holidays**: if possible, decorate the Calendar plugin (https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) to support holidays (search for a certain string in a daily note so the day is marked as holiday and presented in a different colour)
- **Weekends**: if possible, decorate the Calendar plugin (https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) to show weekends in a different style
